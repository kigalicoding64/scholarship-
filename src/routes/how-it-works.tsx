const FAQS = [
  {
    q: "How does ElScholarship verify scholarships?",
    a: "Our editorial team verifies every entry directly against the granting institution's official domain. We cross-check funding scope, eligibility rules, and active deadlines before publishing.",
  },
  {
    q: "Are my uploaded documents secure in the Vault?",
    a: "Yes. All files in your Document Vault are encrypted at rest (AES-256) and in transit (TLS 1.3). They are strictly accessed only for your designated applications and are never shared with third parties.",
  },
  {
    q: "What happens after I request Managed Concierge service?",
    a: "An assigned scholarship officer reviews your vault documents within 24 hours, flags any missing or non-compliant requirements, prepares your portal forms, and files the official application. You receive a confirmation receipt and reference ID on your dashboard.",
  },
  {
    q: "Can I apply for multiple scholarships using one set of documents?",
    a: "Yes! Your primary academic records (transcripts, degrees, passport, language tests) stay in your Vault and automatically link across applications. You only need to tailor your Statement of Purpose (SOP) or Research Proposal for each target program.",
  },
  {
    q: "What if my target scholarship requires direct email/portal submission from my recommenders?",
    a: "If a university portal requires direct professor submission, our system triggers an automated recommendation request link to your referee's institutional email address or notifies your Concierge officer to manage portal invites.",
  },
  {
    q: "What is the difference between Fully Funded and Partially Funded listings?",
    a: "Fully Funded listings cover 100% of tuition, provide a monthly living stipend, and often include roundtrip airfare and health insurance. Partially Funded scholarships cover tuition only or provide a fixed one-time grant.",
  },
  {
    q: "Do I need certified/legalized document translations right away?",
    a: "For initial directory browsing and concierge preparation, official English translations are sufficient. If your target university requires embassy legalization or apostille certification, your Concierge officer will notify you ahead of the final submission deadline.",
