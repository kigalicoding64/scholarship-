# ElScholarship Hub

Act as a Senior Lead Architect and Full-Stack SaaS Developer. Build a complete, production-ready web platform for "ElScholarship"—a global scholarship platform that provides verified scholarship listings and managed application (concierge) services.

Build the frontend with React, Tailwind CSS, TypeScript, and Lucide React icons, and integrate Supabase as the backend for Authentication, Database, and File Storage.
